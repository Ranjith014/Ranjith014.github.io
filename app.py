# --- 3. CREATE AND LAUNCH THE GRADIO INTERFACE ---
# We create the interface and assign it to a variable, e.g., 'demo'.

    # The input image type is now the default NumPy array, not a filepath.
    inputs=[gr.Image(), gr.Textbox(lines=5, label="Patient Notes")],
    outputs="text",
    title="MedPredict: Disease Diagnosis Assistant",
    description="Upload a medical image and enter patient notes to get a potential diagnosis. If an error occurs, the details will be displayed here.",
    examples=[
        ["sample_image.jpg", "Patient reports blurry vision."]
    ]
)

# Finally, we launch the interface we just created.
# When hosting on Hugging Face, you can simply use .launch()
demo.launch()
